# React State Introduction Project

Embark on a comprehensive exploration of React state, understanding its role in components and containers. Delve into the lifecycle of a component, exploring the intricacies of modifying state and executing code in the correct order. Learn the concept of controlled components, harness the power of forms in React, and discover the art of reusing smaller, pure components while lifting state to principal containers.

## Resources

- [State and lifecycle](state-lifecycle-link)
- [SetState and State callback](setstate-callback-link)
