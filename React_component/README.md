# React Component

Embark on a deep dive into React components, exploring the decision-making between using a Class or a function for component creation. The project covers the lifecycle of a Class component, effective testing strategies, and the utilization of Jest spy functions to verify function calls. Learn the intricacies of Higher Order Components (HOCs) and discover techniques for optimizing performance and controlling component rendering.
